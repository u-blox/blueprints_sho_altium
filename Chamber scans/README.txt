EVK and blueprint - RF chamber scans

Unzip the selected file to a folder. 
Each folder contains four files and four similarly named sub-folders:
<board>-2d.html and <board>-2d-files folder
<board>-3d-xy.html and <board>-3d-xy-files folder
<board>-3d-xz.html and <board>-3d-xz-files folder
<board>-3d-yz.html and <board>-3d-yz-files folder

Open the HTML file in a web browser to view the plot.

The 3D plots display the same data. The only difference is the initial 
view according to the plane in the filename. For example, <board>-3d-xy.html
shows the plot looking at the X-Y plane with the Z-axis "out of the page".
Hovering over a point on the 3D plot will show the measured EIRP, azimuth,
and elevation. Click and drag the plot to rotate it.

The 2D plots display slices of the 3D plot at the X-Y, X-Z, and Y-Z planes.
Hovering over the plot will show the EIRP, angle, and an indication of 
whether the horizontal or vertical antenna axis was used, or a combined 
measurement of the two.
