# u-blox blueprints

This repository contains u-blox blueprints (reference designs) created using
Altium Designer.

There are two sets of files maintained within the blueprints_sho_altium
repository:
1. Designs
2. Chamber scans

## Designs
The designs folder contain the schematic and PCB design files for u-blox blueprint
reference designs. See the README.md within the Designs folder for the most
current list.

## Chamber scans
The chamber scan folders contain far field 2D and 3D radiation pattern scans
for a blueprint or EVK. See the README.md within the Chamber scans folder for
viewing instructions.

The folder structure is arranged like this:
```
/--+---Designs (Altium design files)
   |   |
   |   +--- Bxxx
   |   +--- Byyy
   |   +--- Bzzz
   |   ...
   |
   +---Chamber scans
       |
       +--- Bxxx
       +--- Byyy
       +--- Bzzz
       +--- EVK-abcd
```
... where "Bxxx", "Byyy", etc. are the blueprint numbers and "EVK-abcd" is the 
EVK board name.
