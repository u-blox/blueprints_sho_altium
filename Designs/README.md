# u-blox blueprint design files.

The designs contained within this repository are u-blox blueprints created with
Altium Designer. These are example designs suitable for a starting point in an
end-product. These are not full EVKs, rather an example of a feature used in a
project.

The following blueprints are maintained here:

```
The main files to view the design in Altium are the .PrjPcb, .SchDoc, .PcbDoc, and .IntLib.
B216 and B217 each have three variants, one each for BMD-300, BMD-330, and BMD-360 modules.
Other boards only have one variant, so the ".PcbDocVariants" file may not be present.

The other files are generated by Altium, and are provided here for user convenience.
